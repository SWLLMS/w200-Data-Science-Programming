The Bisection method is a better choice for finding the square root of larger numbers because it sections off where a possible answer could be by looking at the midpoint of the range between 0 and X, it will iterate through each window until it has only one midpoint which will be the square root of X. A simpler explanation would be that bisection does not look for all possible solutions, it looks for the most likely guess within a range until it is out of possible guesses and arrives at an answer, taking far less time to compute.**\n"

We enter our guess 4 and then iterates through our guess until arriving at something close to the square root.

    "## Reading and Writing Data (25 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be reading and writing data. Yes, finally some data science (or at least some exploratory data analysis)! In the week_10 assignment folder, there are three data files named: \n",
    "\n",
    "* data.csv\n",
    "* data.json\n",
    "* data.pkl\n",
    "\n",
    "These are three common file formats. You can run the following **on the bash command line** to see what is in each file (this will not work from a Windows prompt but will work in git bash):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "head data.csv\n",
    "head data.pkl\n",
    "head data.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see that there is some method to the madness but that each file format has its peculiarities. Each file contains a portion of the total dataset that altogether comprises 100 records, so you need to **read in all of the files and combine them into some standard format** with which you are comfortable. Aim for something standard where each \"row\" is represented in the same format. **Name this object that contains the data for all three files combined ```full_data```**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to answer (75 points: each question is worth 15 points):\n",
    "After you've standardized all of the data, report the following information: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the unique countries in the dataset, sorted alphabetically?  Write to a new file called question_1.csv.\n",
    "2. What are the unique complete email domains in the dataset, sorted alphabetically?  Write to a new file called question_2.csv. \n",
    "3. What are the first names of everyone (including duplicates) that do not have a P.O. Box address, sorted alphabetically?  Write to a new file called question_3.csv.\n",
    "4. What are the full names of the first 5 people when you sort the data alphabetically by country?  Write to a new file called question_4.csv.\n",
    "5. What are the full names of the first 5 people when you sort the data numerically ascending by phone number?  Write to a new file called question_5.csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a script to examine and grade your .csv files so please make sure: \n",
    "- The answers are all in one **column** with one list item per cell, sorted as stated in the question. I.e., looking at the .csv in a spreadsheet editor like Google Sheets, all answers would be in the 'A' column, with the first entry in A1, the second in A2, etc.\n",
    "- Please do not include a header; just the answers to the questions.\n",
    "- It is strongly recommended that you open each .csv file to ensure the answers are there and displayed correctly! \n",
    "- Don't include quotes around the list items.  I.e., strip the leading and trailing quotes, if necessary, from items when you write to the .csv files.  For example, a list entry should look like ```Spain``` rather than ```\"Spain\"```. One exception: Some country names do contain commas and it is ok to have quotes: ```\"\"``` around just those country names so that they will be in one cell in the .csv. \n",
